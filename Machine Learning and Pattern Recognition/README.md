# Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition 2021

Course covers the main theories, techniques, and algorithms in machine learning and pattern recognition, starting with simple topics such as linear regression/classification and ending up with more advanced topics such as artificial neural networks and model complexity selection and performance estimation. For pattern recognition most popular feature extraction techniques are introduced and Bayesian decision theory is studied. Both main unsupervised and supervised learning techniques are considered with emphasize on how, why and when they work.

Course exercise focuses on pattern recognition and the task is to build an algorithm to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
