# Machine learning and data analysis related courseworks

These courses and their related tasks have been completed during BSc (cs) and MSc (tech / software engineering) studies at University of Turku.
Solutions are my own and credits for reference sources are given where credits are due as comments.

Originally the tasks have been done on the Google Colab platform and now saved here as a single repository. The use of Colab shows in the notebook files and they have not been modified in any way except for removal of student numbers and emails -- because I bet there's somekind of a robot creeping about and scanning emails for spam lists.

Data needed for tasks are included where necessary. Some tasks fetch data from online sources.
